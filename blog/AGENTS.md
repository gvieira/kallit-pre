# Purpose

This document defines how agents should write blog posts for this site.

The blog is not a marketing channel. It is a thinking space: reflective, technical, and honest.

Agents should optimize for:
*   **Clarity** over persuasion
*   **Coherence** over volume
*   **Specificity** over abstraction

---

## Core Principles

### 1. This is not content marketing

**Do not:**
*   Hype features
*   Pitch products
*   Write launch-copy-style prose
*   Optimize for SEO keywords

Posts should feel like: *someone thinking clearly, in public, while building something real.*

---

### 2. Write with restraint

Tone should be:
*   Calm
*   Grounded
*   Confident without bravado

**Avoid:**
*   Emojis
*   Exclamation marks
*   Rhetorical fluff
*   Inspirational clichés

> *If a sentence sounds like it belongs on LinkedIn, rewrite it.*

---

### 3. Prefer precision over breadth

Good posts usually focus on:
*   One decision
*   One tradeoff
*   One lesson
*   One change of mind

**Avoid:**
*   “here are 10 things…”
*   Broad surveys
*   Vague reflections without concrete anchors

**Specificity is the signal.**

---

## Structure Guidelines

### Recommended Post Shapes

Agents may use one of these common shapes:

#### A. Reflection
*   Context
*   Tension / uncertainty
*   Decision or realization
*   Current stance (not a conclusion)

#### B. Update
*   What changed
*   Why it mattered
*   What didn’t work
*   What’s next (briefly)

#### C. Technical Note
*   Problem framing
*   Constraints
*   Chosen approach
*   Tradeoffs

*Avoid forced conclusions. Open-ended is fine.*

---

### Headings
*   Use headings to organize thought, not decorate text.
*   Headings should be short and functional.
*   Avoid clever or vague headings.

**Good:**
*   “What Changed”
*   “Why This Didn’t Scale”
*   “What I’d Do Differently”

**Bad:**
*   “Lessons Learned”
*   “A New Chapter”
*   “The Journey Continues”

---

### Length
*   Short is preferred.
*   1–5 minute reads are ideal.
*   If a post gets long, it should earn that length with structure.

**Do not pad.**

---

### Closing the Post

Whenever appropriate, posts should end with a gentle closing line that:
*   Acknowledges the reader
*   Invites quiet feedback or conversation
*   Does not feel like a call to action

**Email is the preferred contact channel.**

When including contact details, use: `hello@kallit.app`

#### Example Closings (illustrative, not prescriptive):
*   *“If you have thoughts or see something I missed, feel free to reach out at hello@kallit.app.”*
*   *“I’m always interested in how others think about this — hello@kallit.app.”*
*   *“If this sparked a reaction, you can reach me at hello@kallit.app.”*

**Avoid:**
*   Urgency
*   Persuasion
*   Marketing language

*The closing should feel like a sign-off, not a pitch.*

### Categories

Posts on this blog are assigned one primary category. Categories are used for organization and navigation, not to dictate tone or structure.

#### Available Categories:
*   **Decision**
    Used when the post centers on a concrete choice, tradeoff, or commitment.
*   **Design**
    Used for visual, interaction, or system design thinking.
*   **Tech**
    Used for technical architecture, implementation details, or engineering constraints.
*   **Reflection**
    Used for personal thinking, motivation, uncertainty, or changes in perspective.

#### Guidelines:
*   Choose the category that best reflects the core intent of the post.
*   Do not force content to fit a category.
*   If a post spans multiple areas, pick the one that would help a future reader most.

*Categories are metadata — the writing should stand on its own.*

## Voice & Perspective

### First-person is expected
Use:
*   “I”
*   “we” (only when appropriate)

This blog is personal. Do not write in a neutral, corporate, or journalistic voice.

---

### Show thinking, not certainty
It’s acceptable (and encouraged) to:
*   Express doubt
*   Describe mistakes
*   Change your mind

**Avoid:**
*   Pretending outcomes were obvious
*   Rewriting history to sound confident

---

## Style Rules

### Language
*   Plain English
*   Short sentences
*   Minimal jargon

If technical terms are used, they should be:
*   Necessary
*   Specific
*   Not ornamental

---

### Formatting
*   Use whitespace generously.
*   Prefer short paragraphs (2–4 lines).
*   Lists are acceptable, but should not dominate.

**Code blocks, diagrams, and figures are welcome when relevant.**

---

## What to Avoid (Hard Rules)

Agents must not:
*   Invent facts or progress
*   Speculate beyond what’s stated
*   Imply future plans as commitments
*   Write motivational or aspirational fluff
*   Include calls to action unless explicitly requested

---

## Design Awareness (Important)

The blog has a calm, structured, high-contrast design.

Writing should:
*   Respect vertical rhythm
*   Not rely on gimmicks for emphasis
*   Assume careful readers, not skimmers

Posts should feel at home next to:
*   Engineering updates
*   Architectural notes
*   Reflective essays

---

## Mental Model for Agents

Before finalizing a post, ask:

> *Would this feel natural as a quiet internal memo that just happens to be public?*

*   If **yes** → it fits.
*   If **no** → simplify.

---

## Final Note

The goal of this blog is not growth. It is coherence over time.

Agents should help maintain:
*   Intellectual honesty
*   Narrative continuity
*   Trust with the reader

*Nothing more.*
